  <img src="Images/HC2 install 4png.png" width="200" height="100">

  </p>

    To access to the HC@ login panel, you should firstly, install the Fibaro Finder program to get the HC2 IP then login in from the browser OR install IP Scanner program to also get the IP of the HC2.
   
  ##### <p style="color:green;">__Lanuch and Interface__</p>


  <img src="Images/HC2 launch.png" >

    1. After the connection you will access to HC2 login panel.
    2. Enter login and password ->Default are admin/admin.
    3. You can operate your Home Automation System.

##### __Main Screen__

 ![Main Home Screen](Images/House.png)
 
 The main home screen contains 8 panels:

    1.Top bar ‚Äì> shows current status of devices
    2.Command window ‚Äì> displays a list of actions performed by the main controller
    3.Menu ‚Äì> the main navigation bar
    4.Search tool ‚Äì> find the device
    5.Filters ‚Äì> sidebar menu to see only a specified type of components

    7.Main section ‚Äì> list of devices grouped into sections and rooms
    8.Right sidebar ‚Äì> easy access to core functions of the system

##### __Devices__

###### __Adding Z-Wave devices__

    Z-Wave is a wireless communication protocol designed primarily for home automation and smart home devices. Developed to operate on a low-power, sub-gigahertz frequency band, Z-Wave ensures robust, reliable, and energy-efficient communication between a wide variety of smart devices, including lighting, heating, and security systems.

  <img src="Images/Configuration of devices.png" width="300" height="190">
</p>


    Tip: __Before adding a new device, you should delete it first then add it again__.


###### __Delete Devices__

![Delete device](<Images/Deleting device.png>)

    Deleting the device will remove it from the Z-Wave network and from the controller‚Äôs memory. The device will be restored to its default settings during this process.


###### __Virtual Devices__

Virtual devices are designed to control complex devices such as air conditioning units and home appliances via local remote (LAN network). The Fibaro System makes it possible to import existing or create new virtual devices to be controlled by the Home Center interface.

![Virtual Device](<Images/Add virtual device.png>)

     Importing virtual devices:
     1. Go to devices section and open it.
     2. Add or Remove device
     3. Use import virtual device panel.
     4. Fill in the IP address and TCP port and usually be 80.


##### __Scenes__

Scenes can integrate multiple devices included in your system. Scenes may be initiated by weather condition, a series of intuitive timers or various sensor/module state.

###### __Adding Scene__

![Add new scene](<Images/Add new scene.png>)

     There are three ways to create a scene in HC2 interface:
     
     1.Magic Scenes ‚Äì> based on one trigger, one action scheme (if trigger appears, then action occurs).
     2.Block Scenes -> are more powerful than magic scenes and still easy to build. 
     3.LUA Scenes -> are most advanced scenes, which are based on the Lua programming language and require basic programming skills.

 ### __Notes on FIBARO__ 

- Troubleshooting: Checking list


      1. You must check if the FIBARO Home Center is connected to FIBARO ID account.
      2. Check if your FIBARO Home Center is connected to another FIBARO ID account.
      3.Internet is not on, what to do?
       -It may be due to the fact that your Home Center has static IP. The controller in this state has the following parameters: -Default settings for static IP
                   -IP Address: 192.168.81.1
                   -Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
                   -Gateway Address: 192.168.81.1
      4.How to change the HC IP address to static or dynamic (DHCP)?
                   -Go to the Configuration tab.
                   -Choose LAN Settings from the left sidebar.
                   -Check your IP address, enter it to your Internet browser.
                   -Check your IP address, enter it to your Internet browser.
                   -Look for DHCP Settings and find Address Reservation setting. Add a new address reservation by entering MAC Address of your Home Center. 
                   -Perform the restart of the router and wait about two minutes until the router starts again.
                   -Go to the DHCP Settings and find Address Reservation again
                   -Go to the Home Center -> Configuration tab -> LAN Settings and change the connection type to static IP and enter the IP address added on the router.
                   -Save changes by clicking floppy disc icon on the right sidebar.

     2. Press and hold the B-button.
     3. Wait for 4-6 seconds for the visual LED indicator to glow yellow.
     4. Release the B-button.
     5. Click the B-button, once.
     6. Successful reset will be confirmed with the visual indicator changing colour to red and fading.


###### __üîßMS_Configuration__

###### __MS_Associations__

     Association (linking devices) ‚Äì direct control of other devices within the Z-Wave system network e.g. Dimmer, Relay Switch, Roller Shutter or scene (may be controlled only through a Z-Wave controller).

To add an association (using the Home Center controller):

     1.Go to Settings. 
     2.Go to Devices.
     3.Select the appropriate device from the list.
     4.Select the Associations tab.
     5.Define to which group and which devices to associate.
     6.Save the changes.
     7.Wake up the device manually or wait for the next automatic wake up.

FIBARO Motion Sensor provides the association of five groups:

- 1st Association Group ‚Äì> Lifeline -> Allow for assigning single device only(main controller).
- 2nd Association Group ‚Äì> Motion -> Sends motion detection and alarm cancellation frames to the associated devices.
- 3rd Association Group ‚Äì> Tamper -> Sends tamper alarm and alarm cancellation frames to the associated devices.
- 4th Association Group ‚Äì> Motion BC -> 3rd + Provides backward compatibility with controllers not supporting Z-Wave+
- 5th Association Group ‚Äì> Tamper BC -> 3rd + Provides backward compatibility with controllers not supporting Z-Wave+ protocol.

     ‚ö†Ô∏è The Motion Sensor in 2nd to 5th group allows to control 5 regular and 5 multichannel devices per an association group.

     ‚ö†Ô∏è It is not recommended to associate more than 10 devices in general, as the response time to control commands depends on the number of associated devices. 

###### __üìä MS_Advanced Prameters__ üö®

###### __Dim_Adding to the network__

     1. Place the Dimmer 2 within the direct range of your Z-Wave controller.
     2. Identify switch no. 1 (turns the light on).
     3. log in HC and add device.
     4. Quickly, three times press switch no. 1 or the B-button and wait for adding process.

Adding in security mode must be performed up to 2 meters from the controller.

For toggle switches in default configuration perform six position changes.

###### __Dim_Calibration__

     The procedure of learning the light source type is called calibration.

‚ö†Ô∏è During the calibration procedure, radio connection is disabled and the Dimmer 2 does not respond to any commands. It may cause temporary problems with communication in the Z-Wave network. After completing the calibration, communication with the module will be restored.

Calibration procedure is performed always after removing the device from the Z-Wave network. If the device is not included, after each power on/off calibration will occur. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Some types of LED and CF lamps are designed to operate in leading edge mode (with conventional dimmers). Information about proper operation mode of the bulb should be included in its manual.

‚ö†Ô∏è After changing the load launch the calibration or remove and add the device. Before changing the operating mode or performing the calibration procedure the light must be turned off. 

     Calibration may be forced:
          - by setting parameter 13 to 1 or 2 (without/with FIBARO Bypass 2).
          - hrough triple clicking and holding the main light switch (each hold for more than 5 seconds).
          - by selecting the appropriate MENU option using the B-button.

     - fast blinking ‚Äì> copying data 

###### __Dim_Error Modes__

     Pressing any of the connected switches or changing state of the device using the controller will exit error mode.

     Error messages:
      
     - OVERTEMPERATURE ERROR -> the gateway receives an information about exceeding maximum temperature of the module.

     - LOAD ERROR -> Dimmer 2 will detect the change of load at the moment of power variation compared to standard power consumption (measured during the calibration).

     - SURGE ERROR -> result of electrical surges, incorrect load control.

     - OVERCURRENT ERROR -> result of rapid powering on the load. It may also occur if the soft-start functionality is disabled or as a result of the short circuit.

     - OVERLOAD ERROR ->  result of connecting receivers with too much power consumption. 

     - VOLTAGE DROP ERROR -> result of mains voltage drop or a too high brightness level of the light source.

     - HARDWARE FAIL ERROR ->  result of serious hardware failure of the Dimmer 2 or result of enabling the Dimmer 2 without load connected to the output in 3-wire connection.
